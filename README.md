# 🚀 Rocket Boost

**Rocket Boost** is a simple yet thrilling physics-based 3D rocket game built using **Unity 6** and designed for web platforms. Your mission is to skillfully guide a rocket from the **launch pad** to the **landing pad** while avoiding obstacles and managing your thrust.

## 🎮 Gameplay

Control a rocket through a series of challenging levels. Each level requires precision, timing, and control over momentum.

- **Thrust (Spacebar)**: Ignite the rocket and gain upward thrust.
- **Left Arrow**: Rotate the rocket counter-clockwise.
- **Right Arrow**: Rotate the rocket clockwise.

Touch the landing pad to complete the level — but be careful! Crashing into obstacles or hitting the ground too hard will reset your progress.
